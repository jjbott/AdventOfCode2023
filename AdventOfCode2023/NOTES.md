My general strategy for these is to not look online at all, beyond for details of algorithms I know. Exceptions are below. 

## Day 17
For Part 2, I spent a whole day writing path algorithms from scratch. It's possible it would have worked, except I was fixated on a simple 2d map, instead of x-dimensional nodes. I may have gotten there eventually, but I ended up swiping a solution off of Reddit and converting it to C#

## Day 20

For Part 2, spent _way_ too long trying to solve the general case, before getting a hint online. You can see my original attempts in PArt2 before switching to a more specific solution in PArt2b

## Day 21
Ended up looking for hints online again, found the "quadratic formula" solution, and went with that. That was almost entirely done in wolframalpha.com. But, there is a lot of non-working code in my Part2 where I was attempting to optimize a more brute force solution

## Day 6
Used some other people's solutions (included) to find bugs in mine by pumping in random inputs and finding cases where the result was different.
